Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a simple post management web page that retrieves and displays posts from the JSONPlaceholder API. Users should be able to view posts in Material-UI cards, open a dialog to view comments for a selected post, delete posts, search for posts using fuzzy search, and maintain the state internally within the browser.

Features:

Initial Data Load:

Upon the first page load, the application will make an HTTP request to the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to retrieve a list of posts.
The retrieved posts will be stored in memory for subsequent operations.
Post Display:

Each post will be displayed within a Material-UI Card component.
The cards will show post titles, content, and a "Delete" button.
View Comments:

Users can click on a post card to open a dialog box.
The dialog box will display comments related to the selected post by making an API call to (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{post_id}/comments).
Search Functionality:

The top of the navbar will feature a search box.
The search box will support fuzzy searching for posts, filtering and displaying results below the search box.
For example, if a user types 'hello', only posts containing 'hello' in their content or title will be displayed.
State Persistence:

The application will save its state internally within the browser.
This means that even after a page refresh (F5 or browser refresh button), the page should return to the same state as before, with the previous search term and results.
Refresh Button:

A "Refresh State" button will be provided.
Clicking this button will clear the local state, fetch data from the API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts), and display the updated content.
Technologies:

The project can be built using JavaScript, React for the front-end, Material-UI for the user interface components, and HTTP requests to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API.
Local storage or other client-side storage solutions can be used for state persistence within the browser.
User Experience:

Users will be able to interact with posts, view comments, delete posts, search for specific content, and easily refresh the data state.
Development Process:

Set up the development environment, including installing React and Material-UI.
Create React components for displaying posts, post cards, the search bar, the dialog for comments, and the "Delete" button.
Implement HTTP requests to fetch posts and comments from the JSONPlaceholder API.
Implement fuzzy search functionality for filtering posts based on user input.
Implement state persistence using local storage or similar client-side techniques.
Add a button to refresh the state and fetch the latest data from the API.
Style the application using Material-UI components to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing design.
This project will result in a functional and user-friendly web page for managing posts, with features for searching, viewing, and deleting posts, as well as maintaining state across browser refreshes.
